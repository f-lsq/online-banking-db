# Online Banking System Database
This project was built as a means to learn ExpressJS, handlebars, in conjunction with MySQL (26 March 2023)

## Overview
This simple application acts as a online banking system, allowing users to view a list of customers and their accounts. In addition, the transactions, current and past balances can also be viewed for each account associated with a customer. Users will be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the list of customers using a set of endpoints. The application was built using the ExpressJS framework, with handlebars, and utilises a MySQL Database for database interactions.

Here is the entity relationship diagram (ERD) of the online banking system:

In addition to the ERD, the following schema diagram was also drafted:

## Business Needs
`Customers` are able to open multiple `accounts` with a bank. Upon successful login to the system, they will be shown a list of `accounts` that they have with the bank. 

After selecting the desired account, they will be taken to a page showing the present and past `balances` in that particular account number. They will be able to request details of the last 'n' number of `transactions` they have performed. A report may also be generated containing their `transactions`. 

In addition, customers can also make fund transfer to any other account *in the same bank*. They could request for a cheque book, change of `address` or stop payment of cheques. They could also view their monthly and/or annual statements, as well as print out the statements.

### Assumptions Made
* The accounts are for **individual** customers (ie. not joint accounts between multiple customers)
* This is a **private** online banking system (ie. caters to individuals, not other customers such as organisations)

## Main Entity of Focus
1. Accounts
2. Addresses
3. Customers (Strong)
4. Transactions
5. Balances
